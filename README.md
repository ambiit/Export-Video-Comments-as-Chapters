# Eagle Plugin: Export Video Comments as Chapters

[日本語](README_jp.md)

## About This File
This plugin exports video comments from the Eagle app as chapters. It enables a video player based on mpv to read the video comments input in Eagle as chapters and play the video accordingly.

## Usage
- Select a video with comments in the Eagle app.
- From the [Plugin] menu, select [Export Video Comments as Chapters].
- The video comments will be exported as a chapter file.
- Open the video with mpv from the Eagle app.
- The video comments entered in the Eagle app will be load as chapters in mpv and the video will play accordingly.

## Installation and Required Settings

- From the Eagle app's [Plugin] menu, select [Plugin Center] and install [Export Video Comments as Chapters].

- Install a video player based on mpv ([mpv](https://mpv.io) , [IINA](https://iina.io) , etc.).

- Download the script [chapter-make-read.lua](https://github.com/dyphire/mpv-scripts) to enable mpv to load external chapter files. (Note: `chapter-make-read.lua` is an unofficial script for mpv created by a third party.)

- Create a configuration file `chapter_make_read.conf` as a text file and enter the following content:
    ```chapter_make_read.conf
    global_chapters=yes
    ```
